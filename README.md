# '73 Seawolf-class SSN

As part of the development of the Seawolf-class submarine for Cold Waters 1962, I created a '73 overhaul variant. 

Ready for campaigns up to her decommissioning in 1987, I've loaded the vessel with the Mark-48 Torpedoes and MOSS.

Seawolf entered drydock on 8 January 1971 for an overhaul and conversion to a special project platform. This included adding a 52-foot hull extension forward of the sail to house intelligence gathering equipment that supported covert operations (including an "aquarium" for launching variable depth sonar and retrieval equipment).

Note that I have not included the "skegs" and thrusters on this version.

Requires at least DotMod v0.4a-2.

## Installation
1) Ensure you are starting with a fresh install of Cold Waters and DotMod v0.4a-2.
2) Download the latest version of the mod from [Releases](https://github.com/wellers/usn-73-ssn-seawolf/releases).
3) If you use JSGME with Cold Waters, unzipped the contents of the downloaded zip into the "MODS" folder - this usually resides under your Cold Waters installation directory.
4) Open JSGME. The addon should appear under "Available Mods". 
5) Activate the mod.
   
_Note:_ if you don't want to install the mod using JSGME, you can just copy the mod's "ColdWaters_Data" folder into your Cold Waters installation directory - the content matches the folder structure.
   
_Note:_ if you don't use JSGME, you can just copy the mod's content into your Cold Waters installation directory as the content matches the folder structure.

## Notes
* To ensure there is minimal impact to your installation of Cold Waters, I'd advise you to apply the mod to a fresh install of Cold Waters with DotMod v0.4a-2.
