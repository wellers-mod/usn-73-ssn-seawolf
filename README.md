# '73 Seawolf-class SSN

As part of the development of the Seawolf-class submarine for Cold Waters 1962, I created a '73 overhaul variant. 

Seawolf entered drydock on 8 January 1971 for an overhaul and conversion to a special project platform. This included adding a 52-foot hull extension forward of the sail to house intelligence gathering equipment that supported covert operations (including an "aquarium" for launching variable depth sonar and retrieval equipment).

Note that I have not included the "skegs" and thrusters on this version.

Ready for campaigns up to her decommissioning in 1987, I've loaded the vessel with the NT37C Torpedoes as the submarine never received the Mark-48 upgrade. Mark-16s and MOSS are also available weapons.

Requires at least DotMod v0.4a-2.

## Installation
1) Ensure you are starting with a fresh install of Cold Waters and DotMod v0.4a-2.
2) If you use JSGME with Cold Waters, add the mod to your MODS folder and activate through JSGME.exe.
   
_Note:_ if you don't use JSGME, you can just copy the mod's content into your Cold Waters installation directory as the content matches the folder structure.

## Notes
* To ensure there is minimal impact to your installation of Cold Waters, I'd advise you to apply the mod to a fresh install of Cold Waters with DotMod v0.4a-2.
